This package contains all of the rendering assets of the engine
used by the mods Half-Life Episode Two, From Beneath, Snow Fac-
ility and some other mods. This contains numerous graphical im-
provements and performance improvements over the original game
engine, adding more flexibility and overall better usage.

Most of the code was written by me, but a lot of code released
in the Paranoia SDK and the Quake 1 SDK was used as a base, for
that they deserve all the thanks in the world. The entire code
base is released with all the edited files in a clean SDK copy
for ease of porting to an already established SDK. The code was
too massive to be a tutorial.

The engine has a motherlode of features that I will not document
here, but in seperate files as it's a big list, but you'll need
to read those in order to use the engine to it's full extent and
be happy with it. I've installed a lot of safeties though, so in
the worst case you'll be greeted with console warnings.

You'll need the modifications made to the delta.lst file in ord-
er to use these features, so I suggest you just copy/paste it f-
rom the demo's mod folder. All the necessary files are available
in the demo for the basic functionality to work.

All entities are listed with their FGD entries in SDK - Entities.

I strongly suggest you look around the project settings to see w-
hat kind of optimization options I had enabled. They really help
on improving performance, and without them you won't get the top-
most fps you can achieve. I strongly urge you to set your optimi-
zation options up the same way.

You can freely use this code in any of your works, however only
if you give proper credit to the creators credited in this file
below.
