Trinity is getting discontinued. There won't be any more graphics
updates or that sort of stuff. Why? The reason is simple.
I'm tired of being involved with it, the current release is bugf-
ree and doesn't need anything to update it. Also I don't see this
thing being used to it's full extent. That is a major demotivator
for me.
I'm ONLY going to fix game-breaking bugs, which will be released
under the "f" end mark. I know I have that responsibility, but t-
hat's as far as I go with working on Trinity.

I apologize if I offended anyone undeserving. Stress gets to me.
